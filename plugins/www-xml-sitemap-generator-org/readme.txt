Improve your websites SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and SERP (Search Engine Page Ranking) using an XML Sitemap.

XML Sitemaps, RSS feeds, etc. help search engines understand the content of your website, including Google, Bing, Baidu, Yandex and more

[Google XML Sitemap Generator](https://xmlsitemapgenerator.org/wordpress-sitemap-generator-plugin.aspx) adds powerful and configurable HTML, RSS and XML sitemap features to your website. 

The plugin supports sitemap index files for larger sites and the special News and Image sitemap formats to provide comprehensive coverage for your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How easy is it to setup? =

Very easy! Simply install via the wordpress plugin library and activate it.

Go to the XML sitemap settings page and if we alert you to any problems with permalinks, etc. follow the simple instructions to fix these.

That's it, you're up and running.

= Do you support the special images and news sitemap formats? =

Yes. Both are available simply enable them in the settings.

= Where can I find my sitemap / robots.txt files? =

We create these pages dynamically so you will not find them in your control panel / file system.

Go to the XML sitemap settings page and on the right hand side you will see a list of links to the various pages we produce.

= Why do I get a blank page or 404 error? =

This usually happens when your permalinks are not set up correctly.

We will alert you to this when you go to the XML sitemap settings page.

Simply go to the Permalinks settings page and make sure you are NOT using plain links.

= Why does google think my sitemap is HTML? =

You may have submitted the wrong link. It should be www.yourwebsiteaddress.something/xmlsitemap.xml

Another reason this happens is when your permalinks are not set up correctly.

We will alert you to this when you go to the XML sitemap settings page.

Simply go to the permalinks settings page and make sure you are NOT using plain links.

= Why does google say my website / pages are blocked? =

This is usually because of a problem with your robots.txt file or Wordpress is adding a noindex nofollow meta tag.

This is a problem with your "Search Engine Visibility" on the "Reading settings" page.

We will alert you to this when you go to the XML sitemap settings page.

Simply go to the Reading Settings page and ensure "Discourage search engines from indexing this site" is NOT ticked.
