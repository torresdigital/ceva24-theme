== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Getting 404 error for portfolio Item details page? =
This can happen because of WordPress permalinks. Try going to WordPress Settings->PermaLink Settings and Save the permalink settings again. No need to change anything. This should solve the issue.

= What are the Showcases and how to use portfolio Showcase on my page? =
The showcase feature is meant to work as small Portfolio of your featured works that you can embed on your homepage or other landing pages. You can assign some of your special works or Portfolio items to a specific category like "Featured" (you need to create that category) and then use the showcase shortcode to show only those special works. Use the Shortcode Generator button found in your WordPress page's Visual Editor to easily generate the shortcode you need. The showcase templates are different than your normal Portfolio templates and are specially designed to show 10-15 featured items easily with the best outlook to represent your works.
